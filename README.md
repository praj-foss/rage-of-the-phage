Rage of the Phage
=================
A 2D infinite shooter game where you play as a benevolent 
[bacteriophage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage)
who defends the cell against deadly viruses. It's pixel art
themed and targets Android phones, but can also run on 
desktops easily. It's built using Java and libGDX, and
is currently in development. Here's how it looks like currently:

## Building
Make sure you have JDK 1.8 (or higher) installed.

### For Android
Import the project into Android Studio and run the app normally.

### For Desktop
- In the root folder of project, use the following command: <br />
    ```
    ./gradlew desktop:dist
    ```
- The executable jar can be found in **desktop/build/libs**

## Status
I started working on this game during the great quarantine season
of 2020. Certainly, it's inspired by the Coronavirus crisis and I
have even planned to add sprites for that. The development rate
is kind of slow right now, partly because of the ongoing crisis
and partly because I'm pretty bad at art. Feel free to contact me 
or send a PR if you'd like to contribute.
